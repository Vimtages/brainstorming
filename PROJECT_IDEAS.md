### Oz Night Manager

**Description:** 
Night manager to help you get home by asking you some personal info like emergency contacts, address, name etc. Save the photos of that wild night in a session where everyone can view them, they will last 7 days in the server. Some drinking games to make the night fun. Follow up questions to see if youre ok, emergency button and a chat. More will be added further on.

**Tech Stack:** 
I tought it would be easier to make it with: 
DB: MARIADB.
Backend: NODEJS.
Frontend: HTML,CSS,JS,TAILWINDCSS
Mobile: Kotlin?
Further discussion on this.

**Essential Roles:** 
Frontend developer, backend developer,designer, project manager,Scrum master.

**Additional Notes:** 
So this is a full blown app i would want it to be possible to access through web browser, pc and mobile.
To accomplish this a RESTFul API might suit best for the needs of this app. Let's use MVC+S for the app architecture to make it easy to maintain.
Also i just want yall to have fun and hoo hoo all day, if we can make a startup and win big dolla dolla noice.
There are no timelines and as we say in portugal "vai se fazendo".
